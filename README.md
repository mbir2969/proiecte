C# Windows Form Project. Database connection is established within the code. The project involves working with two tables in a one-to-many relationship (e.g., displaying all doctors for a section in a hospital). The code is generic, and the tables used in the database can be configured from the App.config configuration file. The content of both selected tables from the database can be viewed, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed on the child table.
